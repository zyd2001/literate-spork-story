	One day, Leo sat down and decided to work on his CS400 homework. So he added a lot of text into this story.txt file because that was what he was supposed to do.
	While he is writing is friends call him to play Dota 2 together. He immediately gives up on the homework problem and starts playing.

The next day, when the homework was due, it was marked 0/100 because he decided to play video games instead of doing homework.

He had absolutely incredibly so muc fun with his gamer friends.

Even though he had a lot of fun with his friends, he now was failing his class. He regretted not doing his assignment as it will make it very hard to pass his class.
Then to forget about the failed class, he started playing Dota2 with his friends
